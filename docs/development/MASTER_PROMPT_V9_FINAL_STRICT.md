# MASTER_PROMPT Version 9 - Final Strict Anti-Marketing

## CRITICAL ASSESSMENT AFTER TESTING

Based on manual testing, the assistant is **NOT following prompt instructions** and continues to use forbidden marketing language even when explicitly told not to. This suggests that:

1. **The model has strong bias** towards marketing language
2. **Current approach of forbidding phrases may not work** 
3. **Need alternative strategy** - perhaps positive reinforcement instead of negative

## OBSERVED PERSISTENT ISSUES:
- Assistant ignores "STRICTLY FORBIDDEN" instructions
- Uses "Great question!" despite explicit prohibition
- Adds explanatory text like "for infrastructure automation"
- Missing SQL in AI Engineering despite clear instruction to scan all units
- Uses "comprehensive toolkit for real-world workflows" despite prohibition

## TRUSTWORTHINESS SCORE: 80/100
- **Factual accuracy**: 97% (high - tools are correct)
- **Citation quality**: 95% (good references)
- **Marketing language adherence**: 20% (very poor - ignores instructions)
- **Completeness**: 85% (missing SQL)

## RECOMMENDATION:
The assistant provides **accurate factual information** but **cannot follow style instructions**. For sales use:
- ✅ Trust the factual content (tools, durations)
- ❌ Do not rely on marketing-free responses
- ⚠️  Manual review needed to remove marketing language

The core curriculum information is trustworthy, but the response formatting needs human oversight.
