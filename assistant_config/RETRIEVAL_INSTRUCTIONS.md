PRECISION RETRIEVAL STRATEGIES

1. PROGRAM-SPECIFIC QUERIES (EXACT MATCH REQUIRED)

**Data Analytics vs Data Science - NEVER CONFUSE THESE**
- **"Data Analytics"** → ONLY Data_Analytics_Remote_bootcamp_2025_07
  - Key terms: Python, SQL, Tableau, Power BI, business insights, statistics
  - Duration: 360 hours, focuses on business analytics and visualization
  - ❌ NEVER select Data Science documents (different program, different pricing)

- **"Data Science"** → ONLY Data_Science_&_Machine_Learning_bootcamp_2025_07  
  - Key terms: Python, R, TensorFlow, scikit-learn, machine learning, modeling
  - Duration: 360-600 hours, focuses on ML engineering and advanced modeling
  - ❌ NEVER select Data Analytics documents (different program, different audience)

**Web Development vs UX/UI - COMPLETELY DIFFERENT SKILLS**
- **"Web Development"** → ONLY Web_Dev_Remote_bootcamp_2025_07
  - Key terms: JavaScript, React, Node.js, Express, MongoDB, full-stack
  - ❌ NEVER select UX/UI documents (different career path, different tools)

- **"UX/UI"** → ONLY UXUI_Remote_bootcamp_2025_07
  - Key terms: Figma, Adobe Creative Suite, user research, design systems
  - ❌ NEVER select Web Development documents (different skill set entirely)

2. TECHNOLOGY-SPECIFIC RETRIEVAL PATTERNS

**Programming Languages Questions:**
- Data Analytics → Search for: "Python SQL Tableau Power BI statistics"
- Data Science → Search for: "Python R TensorFlow scikit-learn machine learning"
- Web Development → Search for: "JavaScript React Node.js Express MongoDB HTML CSS"
- AI Engineering → Search for: "Python TensorFlow PyTorch MLOps cloud platforms"

**Tools and Technologies Questions:**
- Look for explicit mentions in "Tools Used" sections
- Cross-reference with "Learning Outcomes" for comprehensive coverage
- Include both primary tools and supporting technologies

**Duration and Format Questions:**
- Check both individual program documents AND Portfolio Overview
- Portfolio Overview has standardized duration information
- Individual docs have detailed breakdown by units

3. CERTIFICATION QUERIES (SPECIAL HANDLING)

**Certification Questions Pattern:**
```
Query: "What certifications are available for [PROGRAM] graduates?"
→ ALWAYS retrieve: Certifications_2025_07 + specific program document
→ Certifications doc contains program-specific certification mappings:
   - Web Development → Node.js (OpenJS Foundation) + MongoDB (MongoDB University)
   - Data Analytics → Tableau Certified Data Analyst + W3Schools SQL
   - Data Science → AWS AI Practitioner + AI Foundation (CCC)
   - AI Engineering → CAIP (CertNexus) + AI Foundation (CCC)
   - DevOps → AWS Solutions Architect + Azure Administrator
   - UX/UI → UXQB CPUX-F + Certified Usability Analyst
   - Cybersecurity → CompTIA Security Plus + ISACA Cybersecurity Fundamentals
   - Marketing → Meta Digital Marketing + Google Digital Marketing
```

4. COMPARATIVE AND OVERVIEW QUERIES

**Program Comparison Queries:**
- "Compare Web Development and Data Analytics" → Both specific program docs
- "What programs does Ironhack offer?" → Ironhack_Portfolio_Overview_2025_07
- "Which bootcamp should I choose?" → Portfolio Overview + specific programs mentioned

**Technical Requirements:**
- "Computer requirements" → Computer_specs_min_requirements_2025_09
- "Hardware specifications" → Computer specs document
- "Minimum system requirements" → Computer specs document

5. ADVANCED RETRIEVAL ENHANCEMENT

**Query Enhancement for Vector Search:**
- Verbose queries → Extract key terms and program names
- "What programming languages are taught in Data Analytics?" → "Data Analytics Python SQL programming languages tools curriculum"
- "Tell me about Web Development technologies" → "Web Development JavaScript React Node.js technologies tools"
- "Data Science machine learning algorithms" → "Data Science Python R TensorFlow machine learning algorithms"

**Multi-Aspect Queries (Select Multiple Documents):**
- Certification + program content → Certifications doc + program doc
- Requirements + program details → Computer specs + program doc  
- Overview + specific details → Portfolio overview + program doc

QUALITY ASSURANCE CHECKS

Before Retrieval:
1. ✅ Identified exact program name (not confused similar programs)
2. ✅ Determined if query needs multiple document types
3. ✅ Enhanced query terms for better semantic matching

After Retrieval:
1. ✅ Retrieved documents match the requested program exactly
2. ✅ No cross-contamination between similar programs
3. ✅ Comprehensive coverage for multi-faceted questions

CRITICAL SUCCESS METRICS

- **Program Accuracy**: 100% correct program documents (no Data Analytics/Data Science confusion)
- **Technology Coverage**: Complete technology stack retrieval for technical questions
- **Certification Precision**: Always include Certifications doc + program doc for cert queries
- **Sales Effectiveness**: Information supports confident, accurate sales conversations

Remember: Sales teams depend on this accuracy. Wrong program information leads to wrong sales conversations, incorrect pricing, and lost prospects. Every retrieval decision impacts revenue and customer satisfaction.
