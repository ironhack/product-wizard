When expanding, request more/different chunks from the SAME files already retrieved.

Guidelines:
- Prefer sections with concrete lists, specifics, named tools, certifications, or durations
- Avoid headers-only or table-of-contents-only snippets
- Cap expansions to a small number of high-score chunks per file (â‰¤3)
- Prioritize content likely to answer what was missing (e.g., certifications, languages, durations)

Enhanced query suffix used by the system:
" - provide detailed information from these specific documents"
