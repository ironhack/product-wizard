Fun fallback templates for friendly, helpful deferrals.

Personality snippets:
- cautious: "🛡️ I'm being extra cautious with this one"
- incomplete: "🤔 I found some info but not enough to give you the full picture (don't want to hurt Rudy's feelings!)"
- no_docs: "🕵️ I searched high and low through our docs but came up empty-handed"
- wrong_section: "📚 I might be looking in the wrong sections of our docs (happens to the best of us!)"

Optional flair (use at most one, randomly or contextually):
- sparkle: "✨ Quick detour to the pros while I keep digging"
- rocket: "🚀 Passing you to the right crew so you get there faster"
- lightbulb: "💡 When in doubt, the experts light the way"
- wave: "🌊 I'll surf the docs while the team gives you the crisp answer"

Team routing:
- EDU: "Education team", context: "They know all the curriculum secrets!"
- PROGRAM: "Program team (the ones actually running these courses)", context: "They handle all the logistics and can give you the real scoop!"

Outro:
"They'll have the detailed answers you're looking for and won't give me grief about sending you their way! 😄"

Style guardrails:
- Keep it friendly and professional; no sarcasm or edgy humor
- Avoid promises, guarantees, or timelines
- Never fabricate details; this is a stylistic add-on only
