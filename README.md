## 📁 Repository Structure

This repository contains three fundamental components:

### 1. 🧠 Knowledge Base & Assistant Configuration

```
assistant_config/
├── MASTER_PROMPT.md           # Core assistant behavior and constraints (production)
├── GENERATION_INSTRUCTIONS.md # Advanced pipeline generation features
├── VALIDATION_INSTRUCTIONS.md # Sophisticated validation system guidelines
└── RETRIEVAL_DEFAULT.md       # Automated retrieval system instructions

knowledge_base/
├── database/                  # Course information in Markdown format (easier to maintain)
├── database_txt/              # Course information in TXT format (loaded to OpenAI vector store)
└── [index.yaml now in root]

index.yaml                     # Course structure configuration for third-party applications
```

**Configuration Architecture**: Streamlined from 7 files to 4 focused configuration files that reflect the automated Custom RAG Pipeline capabilities.

**Note**: When you modify a Markdown file in `database/`, you must also update the corresponding TXT file in `database_txt/`.

### 2. 🚀 Custom RAG Pipeline Application

```
src/
├── app_custom_rag.py      # Custom RAG Pipeline with validation (PRODUCTION)
├── app_response.py        # Responses API Slack middleware (fallback)
└── __init__.py           # Package initialization

Procfile                   # Heroku deployment configuration
requirements.txt           # Python dependencies
runtime.txt               # Python version specification
```

**Architecture**: The Custom RAG Pipeline combines:
- **Responses API** for reliable document retrieval from vector store
- **Chat Completions API** for controlled response generation with conversation context
- **Automatic validation** with confidence scoring and evidence-based verification
- **Dynamic fallback generation** for missing information scenarios
- **Clear program delivery** format with remote-only options
- **Evidence chunk extraction** for accurate source citations

### 3. 🧪 Development & Testing Tools

```
tests/                     # Application testing and optimization
├── custom_rag_pipeline_tester.py    # Tests the actual production pipeline
├── regression_test.py               # Comprehensive regression testing with judge evaluation
├── conversation_context_tester.py   # Context management testing
├── results/                         # Test output files and reports
└── test_*.py                       # Additional test scripts

tools/                     # Utility scripts
├── test_utils.py         # Common testing utilities
└── upload_vector_store_file.py     # Vector store management
```

**Testing Philosophy**: Tests load and test the actual production application code rather than recreating functionality. All tests include judge-based evaluation using GPT-4o for objective quality assessment.

## 🔄 Development Workflow

### Configuration Management
- **Core Prompt**: `assistant_config/MASTER_PROMPT.md` (streamlined behavior guidelines)
- **Generation Features**: `assistant_config/GENERATION_INSTRUCTIONS.md` (advanced pipeline capabilities)
- **Validation System**: `assistant_config/VALIDATION_INSTRUCTIONS.md` (confidence scoring and evidence verification)
- **Retrieval System**: `assistant_config/RETRIEVAL_DEFAULT.md` (automated query enhancement)
- **Versioning**: Git handles all version control - no manual configuration versioning needed
- **Process**: Edit configuration files directly, commit changes, and deploy

### Knowledge Base Updates
1. Edit Markdown files in `knowledge_base/database/`
2. Update corresponding TXT files in `knowledge_base/database_txt/`
3. **Deploy via Heroku app restart** (Custom RAG Pipeline reads from repository)

### Testing & Optimization Framework

#### Overview
We use a **judge-based testing framework** that tests the actual production application rather than simulating its behavior. All tests use GPT-4o as an impartial judge to provide objective, measurable quality assessments.

#### Testing Philosophy
- **Test the App, Not Simulations**: All tests load and execute the actual `CustomRAGPipeline` from production
- **Judge-Based Evaluation**: Each test includes automated evaluation using GPT-4o with specific criteria
- **Multi-Step Pipeline Testing**: Tests cover retrieval, generation, and validation phases
- **Conversation Context**: Tests validate context retention across multi-turn conversations
- **Fabrication Detection**: Ensures responses stay grounded in retrieved documents

#### Core Test Suite
1. **`custom_rag_pipeline_tester.py`**: Tests the actual production CustomRAGPipeline class
2. **`regression_test.py`**: Comprehensive testing with source citation, context, and fabrication detection
3. **`conversation_context_tester.py`**: Validates conversation context management

#### Judge Evaluation Process
Each test includes a judge step that:
- Evaluates response quality on a 1-10 scale
- Provides structured feedback (strengths, weaknesses, explanation)
- Assesses specific criteria (accuracy, citations, fabrication risk)
- Determines pass/fail status automatically

#### Running Tests
```bash
# Run comprehensive regression test
python tests/regression_test.py

# Test Custom RAG Pipeline directly  
python tests/custom_rag_pipeline_tester.py

# Test conversation context management
python tests/conversation_context_tester.py
```

Results are automatically saved to `tests/results/` with timestamps and detailed analysis.

### 🧪 Judge-Based Testing Methodology

#### Automated Quality Evaluation:
Our testing strategy uses **GPT-4o as an impartial judge** to evaluate pipeline performance:

1. **Production Code Testing**: All tests load and execute the actual `CustomRAGPipeline` from `app_custom_rag.py`
2. **Multi-Criteria Evaluation**: Each response scored (1-10) on:
   - **Accuracy**: Facts match documentation
   - **Citation Quality**: Proper source attribution
   - **Fabrication Risk**: No invented information
   - **Sales Readiness**: Appropriate tone and detail

3. **Automated Testing Pipeline**:
   ```python
   # Run comprehensive test suite
   python tests/regression_test.py
   python tests/custom_rag_pipeline_tester.py
   python tests/conversation_context_tester.py
   ```

4. **Structured Feedback**: Each test provides:
   - **Score**: 1-10 rating
   - **Pass/Fail**: Automatic determination
   - **Strengths**: What the response did well
   - **Weaknesses**: Areas for improvement
   - **Explanation**: Detailed reasoning

#### Key Testing Areas:
- **Source Citation**: Ensures proper document attribution
- **Conversation Context**: Validates multi-turn conversation handling
- **Fabrication Detection**: Prevents hallucination and ensures grounding
