## üèÜ Model Performance Results

### ‚úÖ **Assistants API Compatible Models (Tested)**

| Model | Fabrications | Accuracy | Response Quality | Notes |
|-------|-------------|----------|------------------|-------|
| **gpt-4o** | 0 | 9/9 tools | Excellent | Best overall balance |
| **gpt-4o-2024-11-20** | 0 | 9/9 tools | Excellent | Latest gpt-4o version |
| **gpt-4.1** | 0 | 9/9 tools | Good | Current model, works well |
| **gpt-4.1-2025-04-14** | 0 | 9/9 tools | Good | Specific version |
| **gpt-4-turbo** | 0 | 9/9 tools | Very Good | Detailed responses |
| **gpt-4-0125-preview** | 0 | 9/9 tools | Very Good | Most detailed (2156 chars) |
| **gpt-4o-mini** | 0 | 9/9 tools | Good | Efficient, shorter responses |

### ‚ùå **Non-Compatible with Assistants API**
- **GPT-5** - Works with Chat API but not Assistants API
- **chatgpt-4o-latest** - Not supported for Assistants API

### üß™ **GPT-5 Direct Testing (Chat API)**
- **Fabrications:** 0
- **Accuracy:** Perfect (all tools correct)
- **Limitations:** 
  - No temperature control (only default 1.0)
  - Not compatible with Assistants API
  - Would require complete system rewrite

## üéØ Key Findings

### 1. **MASTER_PROMPT_V4 is Extremely Effective**
- **100% fabrication prevention** across all models
- Works consistently regardless of model choice
- Strong enough to override model tendencies to hallucinate

### 2. **Model Differences Are Minimal for Accuracy**
- All models achieve perfect accuracy with our prompt
- Differences are mainly in:
  - Response length and detail
  - Formatting style
  - Processing speed

### 3. **GPT-5 Limitations**
- **45% less hallucinations** (as advertised by OpenAI)
- But not compatible with current Assistants API architecture
- Would require major system overhaul

## üìà Detailed Model Analysis

### **ü•á TOP RECOMMENDATION: gpt-4o**

**Why gpt-4o is the best choice:**
- ‚úÖ **Zero fabrications** (perfect accuracy)
- ‚úÖ **Excellent response quality** (balanced length/detail)
- ‚úÖ **Latest OpenAI model** compatible with Assistants API
- ‚úÖ **Optimal performance** for sales context
- ‚úÖ **Future-proof** (actively maintained)

**Sample Response Quality:**
```
Great question! According to the curriculum documentation, 
the DevOps bootcamp covers tools organized into the following 
four categories:

1. **Version Control & Agile Task Management:**
   - Git, GitHub...
```

### **ü•à SECOND CHOICE: gpt-4o-2024-11-20**
- Same performance as gpt-4o
- Specific dated version for consistency
- Slightly longer responses (1136 vs 944 chars)

### **ü•â CURRENT MODEL: gpt-4.1**
- ‚úÖ **Zero fabrications**
- ‚úÖ **Proven reliable** with current setup
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Older model** - may be deprecated eventually

---

## üö® Important Discovery: Data Analytics Discrepancy

**Found different durations for Data Analytics:**
- **Remote**: 360 hours + 30 hours prework
- **Berlin**: 600 hours + 50 hours prework

**Issue:** Assistant sometimes pulls Berlin data when Remote not specified.
**Solution:** Prompt needs variant-specific instructions.

---

## üéØ Final Recommendations

### **Immediate Action: Upgrade to gpt-4o**
```python
# Update assistant model
assistant = client.beta.assistants.update(
    assistant_id=ASSISTANT_ID,
    model="gpt-4o"  # or "gpt-4o-2024-11-20" for version consistency
)
```

**Benefits:**
- ‚úÖ Latest technology
- ‚úÖ Better performance
- ‚úÖ Future compatibility
- ‚úÖ Same accuracy (zero fabrications)

### **Future Consideration: GPT-5**
- **Wait for Assistants API compatibility**
- **Monitor OpenAI announcements**
- **Consider migration when officially supported**

### **Prompt Enhancement Needed**
- Add variant-specific handling for Data Analytics
- Clarify Remote vs Berlin default behavior
- Test with new model after upgrade
