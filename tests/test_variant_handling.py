Great question! For Web Development, SQL coverage depends on which variant:

- **Remote variant** (360 hours): According to the Web Development Remote curriculum documentation, SQL is not included in the curriculum. The program focuses on JavaScript, React, MongoDB, and other technologies.

- **Berlin variant** (600 hours): According to the Web Development Berlin curriculum documentation, SQL is covered in Unit 6: SQL & TypeScript Foundations. Students learn SQL fundamentals including setup, queries, joins, and CRUD operations using Prisma.

So if you're specifically interested in learning SQL as part of Web Development, the Berlin onsite variant would be the right choice!
