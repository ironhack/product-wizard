## **Course Duration** {#course-duration}

* **Total:** 360 hours  
* **Format:** 9 weeks × 40 hours/week (e.g., 8h/day)  
* **Delivery:** Instructor-led, remote, highly practical and project-based

## **Course Overview** {#course-overview}

This bootcamp prepares students to become **AI-powered Product Managers**, professionals who use Artificial Intelligence to ideate, design, launch, and iterate digital products. Students learn Agile PM fundamentals, prompting techniques, prototyping with AI, and no-code development, while applying ethical and responsible AI practices throughout.

The program combines real-world tools (Jira, Confluence, Figma, Mixpanel, ChatGPT, Lovable) with hands-on projects that simulate the full product lifecycle: from discovery to go-to-market and monitoring.

## **Learning Outcomes** {#learning-outcomes}

By the end of the program, students will be able to:

* Apply Product Management frameworks (Agile, Scrum, Kanban) in real projects.  
* Use AI tools to accelerate ideation, research, prototyping, and communication.  
* Create PRDs, roadmaps, and backlogs using AI-assisted documentation.  
* Design and launch MVPs using Figma and no-code platforms (Lovable, Bubble, Glide).  
* Integrate custom GPTs or AI APIs into functional product prototypes.  
* Build analytics dashboards and apply AI to interpret product performance.  
* Communicate product vision and decisions effectively to stakeholders.  
* Apply responsible AI principles, balancing innovation with compliance and ethics.
